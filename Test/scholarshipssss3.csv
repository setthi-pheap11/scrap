EU CORDIS
Postdoctoral Fellowship
Deadline: 14 Aug 2013 (annual)
Study in:  Europe 
Brief description: [ad#contentadtext]
Top-class researchers from Third Countries are welcome to work on projects in Europe. This helps to develop research cooperation between Europe and other parts of the world – to everybody’s benefit. Marie Curie International Incoming Fellowships are specially designed to encourage these moves.
Host Institution(s):
Universities, research centres or companies in EU.
Field of study:
All areas of scientific and technological research that are of interest to the EU may be eligible for IIF funding. But there is one exception: research areas covered by the EURATOM Treaty cannot be funded.
Number of Awards:
Not specified
Target group:
Researchers from developing countries
Scholarship value/inclusions:
IIF funding is provided for a research project which will transfer knowledge into your host organisation and building or enhancing collaborations between Europe and the rest of the world. The research project will also allow you to advance your career. Financial support is provided for 12-24 months (full-time equivalent).
Funding allows you to:
•  join a European research team that doesn’t have your experience
•  establish a collaboration through a research project with your lab or your country
•  gain new knowledge in a European lab.
Your IIF may also cover a return phase of up to one year. This will be spent back in your country of origin, applying the experience that you have gained. To qualify for a return phase, you must be from one of the International Cooperation Partner Countries. If you want a return phase, you must include details of it in your initial application. And you must specify the potential return host organization in your country of origin.
Eligibility:
• Researchers from Third Countries are eligible for an IIF. That means countries that are neither EU Member States nor Associated Countries.
• Must have either a doctoral degree or at least 4 years’ full-time equivalent research experience, after obtaining a degree permitting you to embark on a doctorate. But that is the minimum. The more experience you have, the better will be your chances of being accepted for this action.
• Your application for an IIF should be made in liaison with the organisation or institution that would be willing to host you in Europe. Host organisations can be universities, research centres or companies.
Note: See the complete eligibility criteria in the work programme which can be downloaded from the call page.
Application instructions:
To prepare and submit a proposal for a Marie Curie IIF, you will need the complete Information package which is available from the call page (see link below). Proposals are submitted electronically via the Commission’s Electronic Proposal Submission Service (EPSS) which is also found on the call page.  The deadline for applications is 14 August 2013.
